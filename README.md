# MassiveDatasetExploration

This repository contains a collection of concepts, techniques, and tools related to the exploration of massive datasets. These methods are designed for scenarios where traditional data exploration approaches are either inefficient or entirely infeasible due to the scale and complexity of the data.

The materials and code presented here were developed as part of the Massive Dataset Exploration course at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ, Poland. The course focused on practical and scalable solutions for analyzing and understanding large-scale datasets, approximation algorithms, data sampling strategies, and more.
